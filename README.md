# Training the Image Classifier & Creating a Web App 🐄🖥️
## Indigenous Cattle Breed Classifier Web App

This innovative project was spearheaded by [Ajit Kumar Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sajit9285/), focusing on the development of a web application capable of classifying indigenous cattle breeds. 

### Tech Stack 🛠️
For **model training**, the following technologies were employed (detailed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)):
- PyTorch: version 2.1.2 🚀
- Python: version 3.9 🐍

For **model deployment**, these tools brought the project to life:
- Render 🌐
- Flask: version 1.0.2 🌟
